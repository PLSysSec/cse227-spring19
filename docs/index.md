This course focuses on computer security, exploring a range of topics – from
systems security to web security, edge-network security, and privacy – to illustrate
some of the modern research challenges in the area and the standards for
advancement.  It is not designed to be a tutorial course, but rather to give
students the context to understand current security research and evaluate their
interest in the field.  The course will examine both the defensive and
offensive side of the field. At the conclusion of the course, the student will
have the foundation to conduct research in computer security and to apply the
latest security research to a particular area of practice. 

### Grading

Since the primary goal of this course is to prepare to you to do research, the
grading and evaluation for this course is simple: (1) participate in class
discussions and (2) work on a project, write the research paper describing it,
and give a short talk.

#### Class participation (30%)

Students are expected to read the assigned papers in detail and review the
papers before each class.  During lectures we will discuss the papers and
evaluate students based on their participation and not just reviews.  Students
are encouraged to lead discussions (in teams of 2) but not required.

#### Research project (70%)

In groups of 3-5, students are expected to work on a research project.  The
goal of the project is to do original research in computer security that can be
submitted to a workshop/conference. Part of the project entails a write-up and
short presentation at the end of the quarter.

We will have best paper awards at the end of the quarter!
